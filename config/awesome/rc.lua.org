#+TITLE: Awesome Config
* Initial Configurations
** Luarocks check
 If LuaRocks is installed, make sure that packages installed through it are
 found (e.g. lgi). If LuaRocks is not installed, do nothing.
#+begin_src lua
  pcall(require, "luarocks.loader")
#+end_src

** Standard awesome library
#+begin_src lua
local gears = require("gears")
local awful = require("awful")
require("awful.autofocus")
#+end_src

** Widget and layout library
#+begin_src lua
local wibox = require("wibox")
#+end_src

** Theme handling library
#+begin_src lua
local beautiful = require("beautiful")
#+end_src

** Notification library
#+begin_src lua
local naughty = require("naughty")
local menubar = require("menubar")
local hotkeys_popup = require("awful.hotkeys_popup")
#+end_src
** Enable hotkeys help widget for VIM and other apps when client with a matching name is opened:
#+begin_src lua
require("awful.hotkeys_popup.keys")
#+end_src

* Error handling
Check if awesome encountered an error during startup and fell back to
another config (This code will only ever execute for the fallback config)

#+begin_src lua
if awesome.startup_errors then
    naughty.notify({ preset = naughty.config.presets.critical,
                     title = "Oops, there were errors during startup!",
                     text = awesome.startup_errors })
end

-- Handle runtime errors after startup
do
    local in_error = false
    awesome.connect_signal("debug::error", function (err)
        -- Make sure we don't go into an endless error loop
        if in_error then return end
        in_error = true

        naughty.notify({ preset = naughty.config.presets.critical,
                         title = "Oops, an error happened!",
                         text = tostring(err) })
        in_error = false
    end)
end
#+end_src

* Variable definitions
Themes define colours, icons, font and wallpapers.
beautiful.init(gears.filesystem.get_themes_dir() .. "default/theme.lua")

This is used later as the default terminal and editor to run.

#+begin_src lua
terminal = "xterm"
editor = os.getenv("EDITOR") or "nano"
editor_cmd = terminal .. " -e " .. editor

-- Default modkey.
-- Usually, Mod4 is the key with a logo between Control and Alt.
-- If you do not like this or do not have such a key,
-- I suggest you to remap Mod4 to another key using xmodmap or other tools.
-- However, you can use another modifier like Mod1, but it may interact with others.
modkey = "Mod4"

-- Table of layouts to cover with awful.layout.inc, order matters.
awful.layout.layouts = {
    awful.layout.suit.floating,
    awful.layout.suit.tile,
    awful.layout.suit.tile.left,
    awful.layout.suit.tile.bottom,
    awful.layout.suit.tile.top,
    awful.layout.suit.fair,
    awful.layout.suit.fair.horizontal,
    awful.layout.suit.spiral,
    awful.layout.suit.spiral.dwindle,
    awful.layout.suit.max,
    awful.layout.suit.max.fullscreen,
    awful.layout.suit.magnifier,
    awful.layout.suit.corner.nw,
    -- awful.layout.suit.corner.ne,
    -- awful.layout.suit.corner.sw,
    -- awful.layout.suit.corner.se,
}
-- }}}
