* Welcome to my precious dotfiles!
+ So you search for something, some tutorials for help with configuring something, and you end up here and are completely blank what is going on
Don't worry this readme is there just to tackle this very issue
* What do my dots contain?
+ These dots contain my configurations for:
  1. Nix Flakes, configuration.nix  (~flake.nix~ and under ~NixOS~ directory )
  2. Xmoand, dwm and qtile Window Managers (under ~.xmonad~, ~config~ and ~suckless~ for dwm ofc)   
  3. some other tools like st, alacritty, kitty, Emacs and other stuff
  *Note* for Emacs, better to use  ~dotfiles/emacs.d-gnu~, I have also got doom.d configured with a lot of stuff, kept as emergency
* How to set it up on NixOS
1. Make sure to clone the repo to ~~/dotfiles~ (a lot of stuff is hard coded to this path)
2. on NixOS, for first time installation first copy ~dotfiles/NixOS ~/etc/nixos/configuration.nix~
   #+begin_src bash
   sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake ~/dotfiles -L
   #+end_src
   and to setup home manager for the first time:
   #+begin_src bash
   nix run --no-write-lock-file --impure github:nix-community/home-manager -- switch   --flake ~/dotfiles
   #+end_src
   finally
   #+begin_src bash 
   sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake ~/dotfiles -L
   home-manager switch --flake ~/dotfiles
   #+end_src
